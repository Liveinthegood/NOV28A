        <!-- FOUNDER OF NATIVE STRENGTH -->



  <section class="box">

    <h1 class="quotebox2">HYAPATIA LEE IS THE FOUNDER OF NATIVE STRENGTH</h1>

    <p class="bodytext"> <span class="pro">THE BEGINNINGS:</span> After experiencing a successful traditional ceremony to have a baby, Hyapatia began studying with two medicine men, a medicine woman <span class="proX">(Gladys Tantaquideon, brother to the last chief of the Mohicans)</span>, and a Hawaiian Kahuna. These teachers shared traditional wisdom from the Mayan, Lakota, Cherokee, Hawaiian, and many other cultures.</p>

    <img class="medicinewheelwordspic" src="images/medicinewheelcirclesoflife_words.jpg" alt="medicine wheels -circle of life  - picture">

    <p class="bodytext">In 2001 Hyapatia was elected to the prestigious position of Blessed Woman for the Lost River band of the Cherokee. Every weekend she taught the people to speak Cherokee, conducted pipe ceremonies and presided over sweat lodges, healing ceremonies. As Hypatia began to teach the many things she had learned from the elders, it became apparent that this information was just as useful to the members of the Lost River band as it had been to her.</p>

    <p class="bodytext"><span class="pro">Teaching Triangles </span> (one example directly above) represents the unity of all creation connected by a central axis. Think of a Triangle as it has three sides, where these three realms are represented as the sky, the Earth and the underworld. </s</p>

    <img class="picture3" src="images/MedicineWheel_mainone.jpg" alt="medicine wheel mainone - picture">



    <p class="bodytext"> <span class="pro">HEAL THE PAST:</span> Few of us escape childhood unscathed and Hyapatia is no exception.  With the help of the medicine wheels,  <span class="proX">(one example directly above)</span> we can heal from our past.  The tools on the Native Strength path will show us how to connect with our inner children and wise elders.  Our inner elders can give us the love, acceptance, and understanding we deserve and have been missing.  They can show us paths to happiness and success we may have not noticed before. </p>

    <hr>

    <p class="bodytext">Medicine Wheels help us to remember and comprehend this complicated system. This collection became known as Native Strength as it awakens the strength that is inside each of us. </p>




            <!-- FOUNDER OF NATIVE STRENGTH, MAYBE A QUOTE BOX HERE AS I CALL IT -->


    <p class="quotebox">Hyapatia knew sharing this knowledge with the rest of the world would help heal many who were suffering. It would be a crime to withhold knowledge that could help others to live a better life.  </p>
